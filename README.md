GOALS

-Give Reserve a clearer purpose by having bigger cards again. The character who can store energy shouldn't have the least 3-costs. Also reduce the frequency of 0-costs in the pool - these felt justified in 6-draw world where you wanted free options because the hand was 20% bigger.

-Make the starter deck more reliable in keeping Doom up, with a 2 Weak and a 2 Vuln source. Bold play.

-Add more "core draftables" in common, things you don't mind getting a few copies of in Act 1 to build your deck around. Losing Condemn was simultaneously both a loss of core draftable Vuln and core draftable Doom, and its strongly noticed that we have a lot of synergy and niche cards and not a lot of solid, simple, common "do the thing that the character wants to be doing".

GENERAL MECHANICS

Reserve is now capped to your max energy. Starting off spicy, I know. Context: Capping Reserves gives us some breathing room on the Reserve mechanic - we don't have to be as afraid of it and it won't plague certain implementations like Stash Away, which can otherwise too easily abuse going to bananas Reserve levels quickly.

Some general text cleanup on various cards, capitalization, punctuation, etc. 

STARTERS

Lil Essence now 2 damage 2 weak draw a card Exhaust. No auto removal. Took it down to just 1 starter. Context: Draw a card mostly added to preserve the 2-cycle opener, following Silent rules. 2 Weak will help with the Condemn change below to secure Afflicted early.

Fuel the Fire+ made a more sensible Starter rarity upgrade (draw a card added on upgrade instead of suddenly shifting which effect has orangetext)

Condemn now 2-cost, values increased (importantly, 2 vuln.). Context: Justifying Reserve with a few bigger cards, especially one in Starter again, and helping Afflicted stick with a 2-turn Vuln to start with.

Starter Relic simplified down to just 2 Embers instead of 1 Ember and draw a card. Context: This version of collector really wants Embers more than a card. One ember doesn't feel like a strong enough starter, too easy to boss swap. Two though...

COMMONS

Darkwood Kindling now Common, upgrades to give an E next turn instead of another Reserve. Context: Filling commons with more solid simple multi-copy draftables.

Goodbye reworked, now Common, 1-cost, simple Deadly Poison for Doom staple draftable card. Apply 7(10) Doom. Context: Filling commons with more solid simple multi-copy draftables.

Flash reworked, now Common, 1-cost, apply (3)2 Vuln and gain 2(3) Temp Strength. Staple Vuln draftable. Context: Filling commons with more solid simple multi-copy draftables.

Misdirect now 1-cost, 7 Block and 1 Reserve next turn (no immediate benefit at all). Context: Reducing 0-cost availability in commons. Always has been too easy of a pick.

(Not a huge fan of this, could be something better) Soulforge given Orange text, the draw a Collectible card is orange. Block raised.

Sideswipe - now 1-cost, and AOE. Thunderwave, but for Weak. Context: Reducing 0-cost availability in commons. 

Roast - Actually implemented as cardtext states, a copy into the discard.

UNCOMMONS

Billow back to 3-cost, Block raised. Context: Justifying Reserve with a few bigger cards

Finalize back to 4-cost, values raised. Context: Justifying Reserve with a few bigger cards. This was one of the only real "Big payoff" uncommons, and it doesn't feel right to just be 2-cost. I could live with 3.

Coffin Nail now 3-cost, 24 damage (sunder values), reduces cost by 1 instead of upgrading damage when it returns. Context: Justifying Reserve with a few bigger cards, cost reduction on a big card feels more spectacular than making a Slice hit a little harder.

Malefience cycle replaced with just the last card, draftable. Auto retains moved to the upgrade, no doubling up on afflicted. Context: Doesn't feel like this can exist side by side with Hurting cycle, and also the payoff is conditional. There's a reason these kinds of cards have simple payoffs by the end. I'm not generally sold that the character even really needs this card, if it's going to be useful, you've probably already won the fight.

Greenpyre back to 1-cost, 1 of 3 cards, upgrades to 0-cost. Context: Consistency with other generators of the same type, had just too spam pick value at always 0-cost.

Hurting - Fixed Hurting giving stage of the Maleficence cycle.

Heatwave moved back to Uncommon. Context: Still too easily solves Act 1 at Common with a single pick. Also Sideswipe being AOE now justifies moving this back.

Scorching Ray -1 damage. Context: Still extremely pickable at 8 damage.

(Likely a divisive change) - Somber Shield orangetext applied, set it to the Block being orange. Context: Somber Shield is so good already, it doesn't need a buff, and automatically wants to target Kindlings more than normal cards. This is a place where the orangetext isn't necessarily helpful if it has to add new text instead of modify numbers (or perhaps, at all).

RARES

Darkstorm upgrades to upgrade the Blightnings instead of wonky upgrade.

Dragon's Trove locked Reserve behind orangetext. Draw increased by 1. Context: Felt like a +1 draw was warranted if the Reserve was going to be locked.

Shadow Daggers bumped to 2-cost. Context: It stronk.

Finger of Doom+ changed to just reduce cost to 3. Context: Somewhat required change to match the Reserves change. Makes it playable without an energy relic.

COLLECTIBLES

Headcrush (Tock 3) bumped to 3-cost. Context: Just feels right. I'd rather make the damage whatever it has to be to justify a 3 cost.

All event collectibles switched to Rare rarity. Context: Mostly just makes them look better. They are Special rarity but special doesn't mean anything to Collector.

Added orangetext to Living Wall. Fixed Living Wall not setting cost to 0 correctly.

Dagger - Lethal Plunge now grants a Strength. Context: Gives a little more value to an Act 3 collectible than just "good damage" which probably has been solved by that point.

THINGS I STILL WANT TO LOOK AT:

Possibly adding one more source of Reserve, maybe in Uncommon.

Somber Shield - It really doesn't need any change, but the orangetext system requires altering mechanics. I love the card as-is. Needs more thought.

Maleficence - Want to give this a chance, and adding more reliable Doom source should help let it shine. But I still have my eye on it, just not sure when it is useful. Maybe merging the old "stop the next Doom removal" thing would help it?

Another full audit on Collectibles. Probably changing more of the ones I left alone, adding spice.

Torchhead. Still don't know what to do here.

Spirit Leech - Doesn't feel like a super useful draft, might just be me. 4 strength loss is good on specific fights, but not on many, and at 2-cost and requiring Afflicted, just feels hard to draft.

Soulforge - Doesn't feel like drawing a card makes sense here. If Torchhead remains attack triggers, Collector may genuinely appreciate just getting some more Shivs. A Cloak and Dagger effect.

Flame Lash - Has a hard time feeling like a useful Pyre bonus compared to everything else. And AOE is better solved by Heat Wave which also gives utility and isn't conditional.

Dark Apoth - I still thought this was going to be a useful card, but realizing that the Eggs affect collected cards, feels like we should just make them relatively normal upgrades. Eggs are such a huge swing right now on Collector power. Perhaps we could add a rest option back for Smithing a collected card directly.

To Ashes! - Not sure on this yet. Haven't gotten it on offer, so not going to judge too quickly. But gut felt like if this was a good thing for you to draft, there's not enough embergen / kindlings in the pool. Or maybe I'm just really missing Fiend Fire cause of the art, and how much Fiend Fire is appreciated in the character.
